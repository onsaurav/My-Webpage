<p><b>HTML :</b>&nbsp Hyper text Markup Language. It is the basic of Web-page Designing. All 
the language (CSS, Java Script, ASP, JSSS) has a goal to create a well HTML page. So the first 
equpments of Web-page designing is HTML.<br/></p>
<p><b>Web page :</b>&nbspWeb page is a document with text and graphich/animation what is show in the monitor.<br/></p>
<p><b>WWW :</b>&nbspWorld Wide Web<br/></p>
<p><b>T</b>o make a site At first we need to design the pages and then the pages published in a server. To design a page 
server is never needed. One can design it from any computer.So, We can devide all the jobs in two parts. 
<p align="center">
<ol type="1">
<Li>Web page Designing</Li>
<li>Publishing that page</li>
</ol></p>
<b>H</b>ear we try to descuse about the first part (Web page design). Do you think that "how do i start?"
or "What type of software is needed?" .Suppose you have a computer then nothing is needed to
start Web page designing. Open the Notepad and write the code of HTML (what you learn next).
Save the code with html or htm extention. When you open the file what is created with html/htm extention, you can see your page.
HTML is not a case sensative language so you can use either lower or UPPER or Both. The most
important thing is extention must be html or htm.
<br/></p>
<p><b>T</b>he first tag of HTML is <b>&lt html &gt</b>. Look all the tag must be coated by < and >. To finish the execution of a tag suppose 
<b>&#60 html &gt</b> we must use <b>&lt /html &#62</b>. So, <> it is the start of tag and </> it is the end of tag.  
After the <b>&lt html &gt</b> tag <b>&lt head &gt</b> tag is used. <b>&lt title &gt</b> tag is used in <b>&lt head &gt</b> tag. Title tag contains the
title of the page.after ending the <b>&lt head &gt</b> tag <b>&lt body &gt</b> tag starts. It is the tag where you write all the equipments of
the page. So the normal forms of a html pages is as follows.
<p align="center"><table border="1"bordercolor="black"><tr>
<td width="500">
&lt html &gt<br/>
&lt head &gt &lt title &gt <font color="blue">Write the title!</font> &lt /title &gt &lt /head &gt<br/>
&lt body &gt<br/>
<br/>
<font color="blue">Put the documents for body! &nbsp (write anything all are shown in the page.)</font> <br/>
<br/>
&lt /body &gt<br/>
&lt /html &gt<br/>
</td>
</tr></p>
</table>
<br/></p>
<b>T</b>his three tags &lt html &gt, &lt head &gt and &lt body &gt are the most common and essenial 
of any page. To create a page this tags must be needed.
